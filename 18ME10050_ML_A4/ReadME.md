# Assignment 4
* The assignment has 2 parts. Each part has 2 subpart A,B.
* Four source codes are given accordingly.
* Each part has a preprocoess section where test and training data are randomly generated. However if you want to use same set for each, then comment the preprocess line in the main function. A sample test and training data is provided.
* To run any code, on a Linux shell, type  ` python <filename.py> ` in the terminal. Data files generated in preprocess are stored automatically.
* The implemented NN in part 1 initiates weights randomly so it is recommended to run the code a couple of times as the result may vary depending on the weights initiation.
